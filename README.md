# AutoBill Freelancers

An automated billing and invoicing system designed for freelancers and small agencies. AutoBill helps you generate invoices, track payments, and manage clients without the hassle of spreadsheets or manual calculations.

## Why AutoBill?

Many freelancers juggle multiple clients and projects but lack an easy way to generate professional invoices, send reminders, and track payments. Manual processes lead to lost revenue, late payments, and frustration. AutoBill aims to solve this by:

- Generating invoices automatically based on logged hours or flat-rate projects.
- Sending scheduled payment reminders via email or WhatsApp.
- Tracking payment status with a simple dashboard.
- Integrating with tax calculation and GST invoices for Indian freelancers.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** & **React** – dynamic client dashboard.
- **Supabase** – database and authentication.
- **Node.js** & **Express** – invoice generation and API endpoints.
- **PostgreSQL** – structured data storage.
- **Stripe** or **Razorpay** – payment integration (configurable).
- **Cron jobs** – automated reminders.

## Features (Planned)

- Client management with contact details and project rates.
- Auto-generated invoices with PDF download.
- Recurring billing for retainers.
- GST-compliant invoicing for Indian users.
- Payment tracking dashboard with charts.
- Email/WhatsApp notification reminders.
- Export to CSV for accounting software.
